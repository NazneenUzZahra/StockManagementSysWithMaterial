Stock Management System
=======================

The project is implemented in C++ language using Dev-Cpp IDE due to the concern of the difficulty 
faced by the companies in order to manage millions of company's stock. There are 5 files i.e 
(items, brands, barcode nos, selling price and buying price) that are used to store the stock's 
items information. The program is also capable of displaying list of entities and stock sales record 
that are captured in Entities file and Stock file.
